                    <div class="cardall-body tutorial-content">
                        <p><strong>Cryptocurrency</strong> is a type of money that exists only in digital form. It’s not printed like cash or minted like coins. Instead, it’s created and stored electronically. What makes cryptocurrency special is that it uses advanced coding (called cryptography) to keep it safe and secure. This makes it very hard for anyone to fake or copy it.
                            Unlike regular money that’s controlled by banks or governments, most cryptocurrencies run on a system called a blockchain. 
                            <br>A <strong>blockchain</strong> is like a digital notebook that records every transaction. But instead of one person keeping the notebook, thousands of computers around the world (called nodes) work together to keep it updated and accurate. This system is called decentralized because no single person or group is in charge.
                            Thanks to this setup, people can send and receive cryptocurrency directly to each other—no need for banks, credit cardall companies, or other middlemen. It’s fast, global, and often cheaper than traditional methods.

                        <h4 class="mt-4">How does cryptocurrency work?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain technology, making them very secure, although it’s still up to investors to choose trustworthy exchanges. 
                            Cryptographic techniques (the process of writing and deciphering code) are used to issue, verify, and secure transactions. Through public ledgers, transactions remain traceable and unable to be counterfeited. This peer-to-peer digital asset system makes it fast, easy, and inexpensive to send and receive payments worldwide. There's no currency exchange needed, nor are there hefty fees. Transactions using these financial assets are publicly recorded, stored digitally, and transmitted via encryption, with detailed coding required for transmission and storage.
                            Other elements that set cryptocurrency projects apart from more traditional investments include:
                        </p>
                       
                        <h4 class="mt-5">Cryptocurrency vs. traditional currency</h4>
                        <p>
                            The government produces traditional currency in paper bills and coins you can carry with you or put in a bank to use for purchases and transactions. You store cryptocurrencies in a digital wallet or, crypto wallet, requiring a private key to access. The government backs traditional currency, while cryptocurrency has no government, bank, or financial institution controls. Banks insure money kept in bank
                             accounts against loss, while crypto has no recourse in the event of a loss. 
                        </p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Core Principles of Cryptocurrency</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No single entity controls the network; consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake) maintain integrity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Security via Cryptography:</strong> Public-key cryptography ensures secure ownership and transaction validation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transparency & Immutability:</strong> All transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, visible to anyone but pseudonymous (addresses, not real identities).</li>
                        <li><strong>Programmability:</strong> Many cryptocurrencies support smart contracts—self-executing code for automated agreements.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scarcity Mechanisms:</strong> Fixed or inflationary supply models (e.g., halving events) control issuance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Brief History of Cryptocurrency and The Birth Of Bitcoin($BTC) </h4>
                    <p>The concept traces back to the 1980s with ideas like David Chaum’s <em>ecash</em> (1983), a cryptographic electronic money system. In the 1990s, projects like DigiCash and Adam Back’s Hashcash (1997) laid groundwork for anti-spam and proof-of-work systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>The breakthrough came in <strong>2008</strong> when <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> (a pseudonym) published the Bitcoin whitepaper: <em>“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”</em> On <strong>January 3, 2009</strong>, the Bitcoin genesis block was mined, embedding the headline: <em>“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”</em>—a critique of centralized finance.</p>

                    <p>Bitcoin sparked an explosion of innovation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>2011:</strong> Namecoin (first altcoin), Litecoin (faster blocks).</li>
                        <li><strong>2013–2015:</strong> Ethereum proposed (2013) and launched (2015) with smart contracts; Ripple expands XRP for cross-border payments.</li>
                        <li><strong>2017 ICO Boom:</strong> Thousands of tokens raised billions via Initial Coin Offerings.</li>
                        <li><strong>2020–2021 Bull Run:</strong> DeFi, NFTs, and institutional adoption (e.g., Tesla accepts BTC briefly).</li>
                        <li><strong>2022 Crypto Winter:</strong> Terra/Luna collapse, FTX bankruptcy expose risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>2024–2025:</strong> Bitcoin ETFs approved in the US; Ethereum upgrades to Proof-of-Stake (2022); growing regulatory clarity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="mt-4"> How does cryptocurrency price work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cryptocurrency prices are primarily determined by supply and demand, where high demand and limited supply increase the price, and vice versa. Other major factors include market sentiment, the utility and technology behind the project, the regulatory environment, and liquidity on exchanges. The price can differ slightly between exchanges because each platform has its own independent supply and demand dynamics at any given moment. 
                    </p>
                    <strong>For Example:</strong>
                    <p>Mr. Ebube launches a coin called EbuCryptic with a fixed supply of 10 million coins. The coin gains popularity and people start buying, causing an increase in demand, pushing the price from $0.5 to $5. Positive news and its eco-friendly tech boost investor confidence. On Exchange A, it trades at $5.10; on Exchange B, $4.80 each reflecting its own supply-demand balance and liquidity.</p>


                    <h4 class="mt-5">Key factors influencing price</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Supply and demand:</strong> This is the most fundamental principle. When more people want to buy a cryptocurrency than sell it, the price goes up. A limited supply, like Bitcoin's capped supply, combined with increasing demand, drives prices higher.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Market sentiment: </strong>The overall mood of the market, influenced by news, social media trends, and public perception, can cause rapid price swings. Positive developments can boost demand, while negative news can lead to fear and selling.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Liquidity and exchange listings:</strong> A cryptocurrency's liquidity—how easily it can be bought and sold without affecting its price—is crucial. Coins with higher liquidity tend to have smoother price changes, while those with low liquidity can be more volatile. Where a coin is listed also affects its price; a listing on a major exchange can increase its accessibility and demand.</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Key events: </strong>Major events, such as security breaches, major developments, or economic setbacks, can cause prices to fluctuate. </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 class="mt-4">What are the advantages of cryptocurrency?</h4>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange, there are some advantages to it versus traditional currency. One advantage being privacy. Although cryptocurrency payments are on public record and anyone can look up transaction information and see the contents of a crypto wallet, you don't need to provide any personal information. This mix of privacy and transparency makes it easy to reduce fraudulent activities like identity theft while also proving transactions were carried out correctly.
                        And no matter what happens to the government, your investment is secure. 
                        Another advantage of cryptocurrency is that it’s global, so there’s no need to figure or pay foreign exchange rates, although cryptocurrency isn’t legal in some countries. You also don’t need to worry about bank account restrictions, such as ATM withdrawal limits. 
                    </p>
